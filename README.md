## Contribution

For now I'm just using this as a personal project to learn how to implement design patterns in Godot. I made it public because I thought people could find it useful. That said, I'm not considering any contributions to this project. If it gains attention, then I will reconsider it and make it more "professional" so others can contribute too.
